      <item value="Returns the input subsequence captured by the given group during the previous match operation.&#10;For a matcher m, input sequence s, and group index g, the expressions m.group(g) and s.substring(m.start(g), m.end(g)) are equivalent.&#10;Capturing groups are indexed from left to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so the expression m.group(0) is equivalent to m.group().&#10;If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match any part of the input sequence, then null is returned. Note that some groups, for example (a), match the empty string. This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully matches the empty string in the input.&#10;Params:&#10;group – The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern&#10;Returns:&#10;The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the group during the previous match, or null if the group failed to match part of the input&#10;Throws:&#10;IllegalStateException – If no match has yet been attempted, or if the previous match operation failed&#10;IndexOutOfBoundsException – If there is no capturing group in the pattern with the given index" />

      <item value="Obtains an instance of LocalDate from the epoch day count.&#10;This returns a LocalDate with the specified epoch-day.

      <item value="nnotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a web request parameter.&#10;Supported for annotated handler methods in Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux as follows:&#10;In Spring MVC, &quot;request parameters&quot; map to query parameters, form data, and parts in multipart requests. This is because the Servlet API combines query parameters and form data into a single map called &quot;parameters&quot;, and that includes automatic parsing of the request body.&#10;In Spring WebFlux, &quot;request parameters&quot; map to query parameters only. To work with all 3, query, form data, and multipart data, you can use data binding to a command object annotated with ModelAttribute.&#10;If the method parameter type is Map and a request parameter name is specified, then the request parameter value is converted to a Map assuming an appropriate conversion strategy is available.&#10;If the method parameter is Map&lt;String, String&gt; or MultiValueMap&lt;String, String&gt; and a parameter name is not specified, then the map parameter is populated with all request parameter names" />
