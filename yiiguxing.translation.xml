      <item value="      Updates instance variables from reading procmeminfo. While most of the&#10;      information is available in the sysinfo structure, the most accurate&#10;      calculation of MemAvailable is only available from reading this pseudo-file.&#10;      The maintainers of the Linux Kernel have indicated this location will be kept&#10;      up to date if the calculation changes: see&#10;      https:git.kernel.orgcgitlinuxkernelgittorvaldslinux.gitcommit?&#10;      id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773&#10;      &lt;p&gt;&#10;      Internally, reading procmeminfo is faster than sysinfo because it only&#10;      spends time populating the memory components of the sysinfo structure.&#10;     &#10;      @return A pair containing available and total memory in bytes" />

      <item value="  The presence of this annotation indicates that the author believes the class&#10;  is not thread-safe. The absence of this annotation does not indicate that the&#10;  class is thread-safe, instead this annotation is for cases where a naïve&#10;  assumption could be easily made that the class is thread-safe. In general, it&#10;  is a bad plan to assume a class is thread safe without good reason.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  This annotation is intended for internal use in OSHI as a temporary&#10;  workaround until it is available in {@code jakarta.annotations}." />
      <item value="  The presence of this annotation indicates that the author believes the class&#10;  to be immutable and hence inherently thread-safe. An immutable class is one&#10;  where the state of an instance cannot be &lt;i&gt;seen&lt;i&gt; to change. As a result&#10;  &lt;ul&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;All public fields must be {@code final}&lt;li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;All public final reference fields are either {@code null} or refer to&#10;  other immutable objects&lt;li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;Constructors and methods do not publish references to any potentially&#10;  mutable internal state.&lt;li&gt;&#10;  &lt;ul&gt;&#10;  Performance optimization may mean that instances of an immutable class may&#10;  have mutable internal state. The critical point is that callers cannot tell&#10;  the difference. For example {@link String} is an immutable class, despite&#10;  having an internal int that is non-final but used as a cache for&#10;  {@link StringhashCode()}.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they may be passed between&#10;  threads or published without synchronization.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  This annotation is intended for internal use in OSHI as a temporary&#10;  workaround until it is available in {@code jakarta.annotations}." />

      <item value="nnotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a web request parameter.&#10;Supported for annotated handler methods in Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux as follows:&#10;In Spring MVC, &quot;request parameters&quot; map to query parameters, form data, and parts in multipart requests. This is because the Servlet API combines query parameters and form data into a single map called &quot;parameters&quot;, and that includes automatic parsing of the request body.&#10;In Spring WebFlux, &quot;request parameters&quot; map to query parameters only. To work with all 3, query, form data, and multipart data, you can use data binding to a command object annotated with ModelAttribute.&#10;If the method parameter type is Map and a request parameter name is specified, then the request parameter value is converted to a Map assuming an appropriate conversion strategy is available.&#10;If the method parameter is Map&lt;String, String&gt; or MultiValueMap&lt;String, String&gt; and a parameter name is not specified, then the map parameter is populated with all request parameter names" />
